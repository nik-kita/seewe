description: Pivot seewe from a CV-specific host to a generic share-page-via-link service (API-first, full rename). Load when reworking the mdcv domain, public serving, or the render machine toward generic shareable links.

Reframe the product: today everything is CV-shaped (`mdcv` records, `/v1/mdcv`,
"Markdown CV" / "PDF CV"). The pivot makes the core unit a generic **page
reachable by a link**; a CV becomes one content type.

Decided: **full rebrand** ([[002.decision]]), **API-only** scope (UI deferred),
gated behind a KV backup. New noun = **`page`** ([[004.decision]]):
`_dev_md_cv`→`_dev_page`, `/v1/mdcv`→`/v1/page`, `MdCvDto`→`PageDto`,
`mdCv_service`→`page_service`, etc. (full table in 004).

ACTIVE — backup gate landed (scripts round-trip; real remote dump = ops step at
cutover, not a code blocker):
- [[kv-dump-script]] — data dump + `pre-pivot` schema photo. Done.
- [[kv-restore-migrate]] — verbatim restore done; `transform_entry` maps
  `_dev_md_cv`→`_dev_page` (field-for-field, schema preserved).

Next: execute the `mdcv -> page` API rename (DTO, db collections, routers,
service, public serving), then take the `post-pivot` schema photo and fill the
transform. Open sub-decision (non-blocking): generalize `kind` beyond md/pdf.

Carry-over to preserve in the rename:
- The render-decision logic in `render_cv` (api/spa_subserver/spa_subserver.tsx)
  — `pdf` → serve artifact; else render md→html in `SimpleLayout` (our site);
  missing blob → degrade to md. To be re-expressed as an **xstate machine**:
  resolve → serve_artifact | fallback_to_site (+ degrade edge).
- Custom md renderer, no library [[seewe-custom-markdown-renderer]]; blobs stay
  in serialized collections, KV 64KiB cap [[seewe-kvdex-write-only-validation-and-kv-limits]].

Next: complete the two subtasks, then unblock and decompose the rename
(collection/routes/DTO/service rename + render machine + migration apply).
